# Double-Linked List Data Structures: Array, String, Word

A fun person project I did in **October-November of 2015** to apply my knowledge gained during the **Data Structures & Algorithms course (CMP 305)** I did during the **Spring 2015** semester in the [American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu).

All data structures are built using a double-linked generic list:

* **Array**: a regular array, just working differntly on the inside with some additional functions that allow some numeric data manipulation.
* **String**: a version of a string object.
* **Word**: a version of a string object string that only accepts words that exist in the attached dictionary file. Unfortunately, it's very demanding towards memory and has a high time complexity.
